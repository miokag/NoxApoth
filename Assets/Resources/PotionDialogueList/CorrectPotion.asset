    dialogues:
    - I feel like a new person! You should charge extra for this kind of miracle
      work!
    - "If I knew healing potions worked this fast, I would've stopped by sooner.
      You\u2019re a genius."
    - "I swear this potion just added five more years to my life. Or maybe just ten
      minutes of energy, but who\u2019s counting?"
    - "A sip of this and I\u2019m practically invincible. What is this, magic in
      a bottle?"

    dialogues:
    - "Well, look at me\u2014invincible! Is this what superhero feels like?"
    - Oh, honey, I'm about to take on dragons with this. Hope you're ready for my
      new badass self!
    - "Is it just me, or am I now basically a walking tank? I\u2019m loving this!"
    - "The only thing dangerous now is my attitude. You\u2019ve really outdone yourself
      with this one!"
