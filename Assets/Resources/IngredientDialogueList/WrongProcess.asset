    dialogues:
    - Why am I seeing a parade of tiny creatures? Are they... imaginary?
    - Why can't I stop thinking the floor is covered in marshmallows? Also, my fingertips
      are like... cotton.
    - "Why is my skin tingling... like it\u2019s made of velvet? And why are those
      squirrels talking?"
    - I  feel... weightless, I can see myself floating above the ground! Is that
      supposed to happen?
  - ingredient: {fileID: 11400000, guid: b73aa5d18ced92a44a67efdf0e0562f0, type: 2}
    dialogues:
    - "Now everything's just... too calm. I can\u2019t even get excited about a dragon
      flying by. Maybe I\u2019ll go take a nap... outside the shop..!"
    - "The calmness... it\u2019s taking over! I\u2019m so relaxed I think I just
      forgot how to move. I\u2019m just here, existing. I might stay this way forever,
      actually."
    - "Now... my eyelids are so heavy. I think I\u2019ll just stare at this wall
      for an hour, like it\u2019s the most interesting thing ever."
    - "Now I can\u2019t stop blinking like I\u2019m in a staring contest with a windmill.
      It\u2019s... oddly peaceful?"
  - ingredient: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 95063c35592a16647a064689d106c60f, type: 2}
    dialogues:
    - "Now I\u2019m a human maraca. Why can\u2019t I stop wiggling?! At least I feel...
      oddly at peace... while jittering like a leaf in the wind."
    - "I\u2019ve never felt so... smooth? Except for my spontaneous vibrating. I
      think I\u2019m half zen, half jumping bean\u2014either way, this feels weirdly
      good."
    - "It\u2019s like my skin\u2019s been replaced with a million tiny tickles. It\u2019s...
      not unpleasant, just... a bit... eager? Oh no, not again, I think it\u2019s
      starting to crawl up my neck now!"
    - "Ahh, it's definitely... working. It's really nice! So nice that my skin's
      practically having a party. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting an uninvited massage
      from every inch of me at once. Calming... but also, um... aggressive"
  - ingredient: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 097f9c159c8fb794f90140cc3845ec35, type: 2}
    dialogues:
    - "Now I\u2019m leaving tiny clouds of darkness everywhere I walk. Do you think
      this is subtle? Because I look like a storm cloud with legs!"
    - "WHY are these shadowy tendrils following me? Is this the potion or is something
      alive in here? It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got clingy ghosts hanging off me!"
    - "Now I look like the villain in a fairy tale. I mean, who doesn\u2019t love
      a good dark shroud, but this is a bit dramatic, don\u2019t you think?"
    - "At what cost? I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s night, day, or if I\u2019m just
      inside a very poorly lit closet. Did you mix in actual darkness?"
  - ingredient: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0c25ca8919494b646aaa43e3d11a6c20, type: 2}
    dialogues:
    - "Now I\u2019m being followed by a personal breeze like I\u2019m starring in
      my own heroic saga. Am I supposed to look this cool all the time"
    - "I think the wind likes me too much. I\u2019m basically a walking kite. Please
      tell me this wears off before I hit a tree!"
    - "Uh... the constant swirling is a bit extra, don\u2019t you think? I can\u2019t
      tell if I\u2019m safer or just destined to annoy every loose paper within five
      miles!"
    - "Now I\u2019ve got leaves orbiting me like I\u2019m some kind of forest wizard.
      I didn\u2019t order the \u2018druid aesthetic,\u2019 but thanks for that!"
  - ingredient: {fileID: 11400000, guid: e5f9956494308f7439d29d2753740f7f, type: 2}
    dialogues:
    - "I leave a trail of frost behind me like some sort of... frosty breadcrumbs
      for giants? I\u2019m practically leading a snowstorm wherever I go!"
    - "Everything I touch gets an instant makeover! Don\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m
      just giving your chair a nice winter refresh."
    - WHY do I look like a dragon that only breathes winter? This is not how I wanted
      to make an impression.
    - My hairstyle is now the peak of winter fashion. Do you think frozen bangs will
      catch on? Asking for my new, frosty self.
